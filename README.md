# Restaurant-Reviews-Topic-Extraction

## Product overview

This solution identifies the various aspects a reviewer is mentioning when providing a review for any restaurant business. This can help businesses easily identify which are its most prominent aspects (e.g. price, ambience, taste, quality etc.) which are getting reviewed and what are the associated opinions about them. They can then improve on these aspects to provide a superior customer experience.

## Product Highlight 

* This solution is trained on a large publicly available dataset of restaurant reviews. Algorithm follows unsupervised attention model based deep learning approach to learn the important keywords in relation with the associated sentence. These words are then arranged into 14 different disjoint sets of aspects and then ranked as per usability in the dataset. New aspects are inferred w.r.t to comparative association of the new words with model learnt set of words per aspect type.
* Due to unavailability or self-biased behaviour of tagged data, unsupervised approaches of deep learning models are gaining popularity. RESTAURANT REVIEWS ASPECT EXTRACTION is an unsupervised attention based deep learning model, which can pay more attention to impactful words in the dataset. Our algorithm is re-trainable w.r.t to client’s data. Currently, algorithm can identify 14 different types of aspects. Number of aspect types is also tuneable while training the model as per client’s requirement. These capabilities of client specific tuning and inference makes model personalized.
